My sister woke me up in the early morning. "They are here!" she whispered frantically. Outside I heard the sound of trucks drawing nearer, along with the soft chatter of men loading their rifles. We grabbed the emergency bags we had prepared and ran out the back. The gunfire started shortly afterwards.
