They handed out rations to us, water to drink, blankets and pillows to sleep. It felt strange to have a bed again--to no longer have to huddle  together with other bodies on a rain-soaked deck, with wind howling in our ears. They promised we would be okay and I believed them, at least the friendlier ones. Then there were the others--arrogant, controlling, acting like they owned us for saving our lives. They reminded me of the soldiers I ran from back home.
