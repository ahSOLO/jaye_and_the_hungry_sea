They asked me for papers, phone numbers of relatives in other countries, anything to establish my identity, my reason for being here. It was so clerical it seemed like they had forgotten about the war happening beyond the horizon. "No ma'am, I don't know where my family is." (I don't even know if they are alive). My interviewer checked perfectly square boxes on white forms with an oblong pen. Is everything here so... packaged?
